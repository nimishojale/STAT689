Exploratory and Predictive Data Analysis of Crimes in Atlanta database.

In this project we evaluate the crime data collected from Atlanta Police Department and examine the effects of 
several location and time-based parameters on the occurrence and type of crime.

MOTIVATION
Atlanta, the capital and most populous city of the state of Georgia, is the 6th most dangerous city in the country according to 
a Forbes report. The rate of crime is more than twice of the national average, with 5203 violent crimes and 25,556 property crimes 
reported in the year 2015. Our motivation for deciding to work on the data of crimes committed in Atlanta in the previous year was 
to analyze the distribution of crimes by region, time, and type of crimes committed, among other variables, and try to develop 
a predictive model towards predicting the type of crime that might be committed given the variables stated above.

DATA EXPLORATION
The data has been collected from Atlanta Police Departmentâ€™s website. It consists of 26,760 data points, i.e., instances of 
recorded crimes, and 23 columns consisting of fields related to occurrence of crime, type of crime, location codes, neighborhood 
in which the crime took place, etc.
